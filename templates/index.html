  <h2>Understand the Risks Before Filing</h2>
  <p>Hosting providers <strong>will forward your abuse report to the site operator</strong>. This is standard industry practice. The site operator will see the full report text, including your description of the violation and any evidence links you provide.</p>
  <p>Operators of abusive sites are known to <strong>retaliate against complainants</strong> by publicly posting copies of abuse complaints and using them to direct further harassment at the reporter.</p>
  <p><strong>There is no expectation of privacy for abuse reports.</strong> Assume that anything you include in your report will be seen by the people you are reporting.</p>
  <p>Your personal email address is <em>not</em> included in outgoing reports &mdash; reports are sent on behalf of our organization. However, you should avoid including personally identifying details in your description or evidence unless you are comfortable with the site operator seeing them.</p>

  <h2>Important: Illegal Content</h2>
  <p>This tool files abuse reports with <strong>hosting providers</strong> regarding Terms of Service violations such as harassment, hate speech, doxxing, NCII, and copyright infringement.</p>
  <p><strong>This tool is not appropriate for reporting illegal content that requires law enforcement action.</strong> In particular:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM):</strong> Report immediately to the <a href="https://report.cybertip.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NCMEC CyberTipline</a>. Do <em>not</em> upload, download, screenshot, or redistribute CSAM under any circumstances.</li>
    <li><strong>Imminent threats of violence:</strong> Contact your local law enforcement and/or the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Other federal cybercrimes:</strong> File a report at <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IC3.gov</a>.</li>
