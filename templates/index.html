  <h1>Report Abuse. Protect People.</h1>
  <p>The End Network Harassment Inc Reporting Wizard automates the process of filing abuse reports with hosting providers when a site's own removal mechanisms are absent, non-functional, or exploitative.</p>

  <h2>Before You Use This Tool</h2>
  <p><strong>This tool is a last resort for sites with exploitative removal practices.</strong> Before filing a report here, you should first:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Contact the site operator directly</strong> and request removal of the content.</li>
    <li><strong>Use the site's own abuse reporting mechanisms</strong> &mdash; platforms like YouTube, Reddit, Facebook, and most major services have built-in reporting tools that are often faster and more effective.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Use this tool only when those avenues have failed or do not exist &mdash; for example, when the site operator:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Refuses or ignores good-faith removal requests</li>
    <li>Demands payment to remove content (extortion)</li>
    <li>Deliberately obstructs or hides removal processes</li>
    <li>Retaliates against people who request removal</li>
    <li>Provides no contact information or abuse reporting mechanism at all</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Understand the Risks Before Filing</h2>
  <p>Hosting providers <strong>will forward your abuse report to the site operator</strong>. This is standard industry practice. The site operator will see the full report text, including your description of the violation and any evidence links you provide.</p>
  <p>Operators of abusive sites are known to <strong>retaliate against complainants</strong> by publicly posting copies of abuse complaints and using them to direct further harassment at the reporter.</p>
  <p><strong>There is no expectation of privacy for abuse reports.</strong> Assume that anything you include in your report will be seen by the people you are reporting.</p>
  <p>Your personal email address is <em>not</em> included in outgoing reports &mdash; reports are sent on behalf of our organization. However, you should avoid including personally identifying details in your description or evidence unless you are comfortable with the site operator seeing them.</p>

  <h2>How We File Reports</h2>
  <p>We file <strong>Terms of Service (ToS) abuse reports</strong> with hosting providers <strong>on your behalf and with your permission</strong>. Reports are sent under our organization's name, not yours.</p>
  <p><strong>For NCII (non-consensual intimate images):</strong> You must be the person depicted in the content, or their authorized representative. We act on your behalf to request removal &mdash; the hosting provider needs to know the report comes from the affected person (or their agent), not an unrelated third party.</p>
  <p><strong>For copyright violations:</strong> We file ToS-based abuse reports requesting removal of infringing content. <strong>We do not file DMCA takedown notices.</strong> A DMCA notice is a legal instrument that must be signed by the copyright holder or their authorized agent under penalty of perjury. If you need to file a DMCA takedown, you or your attorney must do so directly. Our reports ask the hosting provider to enforce their own acceptable use policies.</p>

  <h2>Important: Illegal Content</h2>
  <p>This tool files abuse reports with <strong>hosting providers</strong> regarding Terms of Service violations such as harassment, hate speech, doxxing, NCII, copyright infringement, and self-harm facilitation on sites with exploitative removal practices.</p>
  <p><strong>This tool is not appropriate for reporting illegal content that requires law enforcement action.</strong> In particular:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM):</strong> Report immediately to the <a href="https://report.cybertip.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NCMEC CyberTipline</a>. Do <em>not</em> upload, download, screenshot, or redistribute CSAM under any circumstances.</li>
    <li><strong>Imminent threats of violence:</strong> Contact your local law enforcement and/or the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Other federal cybercrimes:</strong> File a report at <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IC3.gov</a>.</li>
  </ul>
