  <h2>Important: Illegal Content</h2>
  <p>This tool files abuse reports with <strong>hosting providers</strong> regarding Terms of Service violations such as harassment, hate speech, doxxing, NCII, and copyright infringement.</p>
  <p><strong>This tool is not appropriate for reporting illegal content that requires law enforcement action.</strong> In particular:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM):</strong> Report immediately to the <a href="https://report.cybertip.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NCMEC CyberTipline</a>. Do <em>not</em> upload, download, screenshot, or redistribute CSAM under any circumstances.</li>
    <li><strong>Imminent threats of violence:</strong> Contact your local law enforcement and/or the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Other federal cybercrimes:</strong> File a report at <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IC3.gov</a>.</li>
